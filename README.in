## anethum

A common API for parsers and serializers in [io7m](https://www.io7m.com)
packages.

### Features

  * Standardized interface for parsers.
  * Standardized interface for serializers.
  * Parse errors are [structured errors](https://www.io7m.com/software/seltzer).
  * Written in pure Java 17.
  * [OSGi](https://www.osgi.org/) ready.
  * [JPMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System) ready.
  * ISC license.
  * High-coverage automated test suite.

### Motivation

[io7m](https://www.io7m.com) packages expose many different parsers and
serializers. The `anethum` package attempts to define a consistent and
strongly-typed API specification that these parsers and serializers can
implement in order to provide a uniform user experience between all of the
different packages.

### Building

```
$ mvn clean verify
```

### Usage

Parsers should implement the `ParserFactoryType` and `ParserType`
interfaces.

Serializers should implement the `SerializerFactoryType` and `SerializerType`
interfaces.
